# Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated

**LeetCode #1752** | **Difficulty**: Easy

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums`, return `true`* if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated **some** number of positions (including zero)*. Otherwise, return `false`.

There may be **duplicates** in the original array.

**Note:** An array `A` rotated by `x` positions results in an array `B` of the same length such that `B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length]` for every valid index `i`.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 2 positions to begin on the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.
```

### Example 3

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
