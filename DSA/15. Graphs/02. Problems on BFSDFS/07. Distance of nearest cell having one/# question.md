# 01 Matrix

**LeetCode #542** | **Difficulty**: Medium

## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return *the distance of the nearest *`0`* for each cell*.

The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is `1`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]
```

## Constraints

- `m == mat.length`
	- `n == mat[i].length`
	- `1 <= m, n <= 10^4`
	- `1 <= m * n <= 10^4`
	- `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
	- There is at least one `0` in `mat`.
