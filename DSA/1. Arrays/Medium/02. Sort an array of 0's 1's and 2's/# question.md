Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) **so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,0,1,1,2,2]
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,1,2]
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 300`
* `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
